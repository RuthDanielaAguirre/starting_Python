#Tuple is a list but it can not be changed, it is immutable. It is used to store multiple items in a single variable. In order to define it you use () instead of [].

myFinalAnswerTuple = ("apple", "banana", "pineapple")

print(myFinalAnswerTuple)
print(type(myFinalAnswerTuple))

#It can also be accessed by position:

print(myFinalAnswerTuple[0])
