#we can include a large amount of functionality in a few words

#for uses the statement "for ... in" to tell the computer to go through each item in a list.
#range() is a function that returns a list. It takes a starting number and an ending number, but the ending number is not inclusive. (you have to put one more to stop counting to the number you want)


print("count to 10!")
for x in range(0, 11):
     print(x)
